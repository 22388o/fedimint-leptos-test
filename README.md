# Fedimint Client built with [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos)

This repo contains a proof-of-concept of how to integrate `fedimint-client` with the Leptos web framework to build a
PWA. Nothing really works yet but it compiles.

To run it enter the `nix develop` shell, run `trunk serve` and open `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in your browser:

```
fedimint-leptos-test$ nix develop
ðŸ’¡ Run 'just' for a list of available 'just ...' helper recipes

You should see "Starting client" in the browser and the JS console should be logging a lot.
